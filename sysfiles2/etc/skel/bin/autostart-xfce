## autostart-xfce
## ====================
## When you login to your CrunchBang Xfce+Openbox session,
## this autostart script will be executed by xfce (not openbox) 
## to set-up part of your environment.
## NOTE run by sh not bash, so avoid bashisms,
## or change the #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/bash . 
##
## Although you can autostart applications here,
## it is recommended to use the Xfce interface,
## which will add desktop files to ~/.config/autostart .
## NB Such desktop files will also be executed
## by a normal openbox session. To avoid this,
## make sure they contain the line:
## OnlyShowIn=XFCE;
##
## Note*: some programs, such as 'nm-applet' are run via XDG autostart.
## Run '/usr/lib/openbox/openbox-xdg-autostart --list' to list any
## XDG autostarted programs.
